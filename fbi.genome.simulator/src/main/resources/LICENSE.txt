DESCRIPTION
The Flux Simulator is a program to simulate in silico RNAseq experiments as
carried out for new sequencing technologies.

DISCLAIMER AND LICENSE
Copyright 2008-2009 Michael Sammeth, you can do whatever you want with the code,

As always, I take no responsibility of what my program does with your computer.
Watch especially the hard disk activity and space, we talk about potentially
violent data masses and the program aggressively reads and writes in multiple
threads. In the early versions there was not the luxury to build estimating
functions and check whether a certain run you concepted is feasable on your
system.

Take it easy,
